# Covid-Diagnosis-from-recorded-coughts
Covid diagnosis based on recorded coughs

Dataset provided by: https://virufy.org/data.html

Network: ResNet50

## Parameters ##
Standard parameters, feel free to change all of them!

## Score/Accuracy ##
From preliminary tests, it seems that the score are not so bad but we need more record coughs.

## TODO ##
This project is just for fun, there are a lot of possible improvements. First of all, we have to check the input size of the network or try more transformations.
Moreover, other better parameters are possible.
